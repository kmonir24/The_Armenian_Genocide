  <h2> Ottoman Empire Enters World War I </h2>
  <p> The Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of Germany and the Austria-Hungary Empire. During that same time, they declared on a holy war on any Christians that were not on their side. There was suspicion that because the Armenians were Christian, they would side with Russia, a Christian government, over the Empire, which was predominately Muslim. The Empire feared that if the Armenians saw a chance of independence with the Russians, they would become traitors. It was then that they argued for a solution to the "Armenian problem." As the war progressed, some Armenians formed militia and fought with Russia, which led the Turks to install their genocidal plan. </p>

  <h2>The Genocide Begins</h2>
  <p>On April 24th, 1915, the Turks gathered 250  Armenian intellectuals and executed them. The flood gates opened and ordinary Armenians were taken from their homes and marched through the Mesopotamian desert without any food or water. They were stripped naked and forced to continue marching under the scorching sun and any who stopped to rest were shot dead. Killing squads were formed and Armenians were drowned in rivers, thrown off cliffs, crucified, burned alive, and women and girls were sexually assaulted. Children were abducted, converted to Islam and placed with Muslim families, and young girls were forced to marry militiamen. All in all it was gruesome years for the Armenians, who start out in 1915 as 2 million residing in Armenia but there were only 388,000 left in 1922.  </p>
