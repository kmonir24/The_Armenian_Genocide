  <h2> Who are the Armenian Christians? </h2>
  <p> The Armenian Christians are group who originate from the Caucuas region between Europe and Asia. They have occupied that area for more than 3000 years and for some of those years, they were independent. However, in the fifteenth century, they were taken over by the the Ottoman Empire, and became, along with other Christian groups in the region, the religious minority. They were subjected to prejudiced rules such as having to pay a higher tax just for being Christian, and yet they persevered and thrived. They tended to be wealthier and more educated than their counterparts which drew envy towards them. </p>

  <h2> The Nineteenth Century </h2>
  <p> The Nineteenth century saw a rise in Turish Nationalism which turned very badly for the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. Orders were given to sack through villages and slaughter people. These became known as the Hamidian Massacres at the end of the century and were seen by some historians as the "dress rehearsal" for the genocide. Hundreds of thousands of Armenians were killed, and it only continued to get worse as the Ottoman Empire entered into World War I. If we were to analyze this event in terms of Dr. Stanton's "Ten Stages of Genocide," this would be well past the first stage. The ten stages are as follow: Classification, Symbolization, Discrimination, Dehumanization, Organization, Polarization, Preparation, Persecution, Extermination, and finally Denial. The Massacres themselves fall into stage 8: Persecution, which shows how advanced the situation was and yet no stepped in. What would have happened if someone stopped and said, "NO MORE" after the Hamidian Massacres? Would there have been an Armenian Genocide still? </p>
