  <h2> Turkish Denial </h2>
  <p> After the war was finished, those responsible genocide escaped into Germany where they were promised freedom. Although some people were arrested, they were ultimately let go and no one paid for the murder of nearly two million Armenians. To this day, the Turkish government holds steady to their belief that no deliberate genocide occurred, and that whatever acts of violence which took place were necessary for the war. Other nations have been reluctant to condemn the genocide and lose Turkey as an ally; in fact, the United States did not openly condemn the act until 2010 when a Congressional panel officially recognized that the genocide happened, and until 2019 that a resolution was passed to acknowledge it. </p>
  <h2> SO WHY? </h2>
  <p> Why do we study this, when simply reading about the act makes a person's blood curdle, send chills down spines, and just horrifies readers? Why do we put ourselves through the experience of looking at the darkest moments of humanity? What's the benefit of it? It is all in the hope that should a similar situation arise again, we can see the warning signs and stop it. We have failed to do this in the past because less than two years after the Armenian Genocide, the Nazi's recycled some of the torture methods of the Turks and used them. Since then, the list of genocides has only grown, so how do we prevent the next one? It can only be done by spreading love, empathy and compassion and teaching the next generations what happens when we start seeing someone as less-than-human. As long as we feel for others, we can never start marginalizing them. </p>
