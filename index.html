  <h2> The Seven Genocides Assignments </h2>
  <p> Per assignment instructions, we were to pick one of the listed genocides and conduct research on what occurred. The genocide that I have chosen to study is the Armenian Genocide. I first heard about the Armenian Genocide from a friend who told me that his grandparents worked in the embassay at the time. When the genocide, his grandparents had to hide in a sewer for three days before being able to escape to Egypt. Unfortunately, this was the case with many others and nearly 2 million people were not lucky enough to escape at all. As a person that comes from minority group that has  suffered from religious persecuation for centuries, I felt obligated to research and learn as much about the Armenian Genocide as possible and present it to you today.
